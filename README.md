Project 2 - This project will create a simple Theater Booking System. It allows users to view shows, book tickets, and manage their bookings. The program will use arrays, pointers, structures, enumerations, and file operations to store and manage data.


How to Use --> Run the Program: Compile and execute the program in a C environment. --> View Shows: The list of available movies will be displayed, including the title, showtimes, and prices. --> Book Tickets: Select a movie from the list and enter the number of tickets you wish to book. After booking, your reservation details will be shown. --> View Your Bookings: You can check your bookings at any time during the session. --> File Operations: The system automatically saves booking data to a file, which is loaded when the program starts.
